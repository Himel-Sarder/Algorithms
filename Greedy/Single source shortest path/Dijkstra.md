Let's go **line-by-line** through your code and explain everything in detail — with **conceptual visualizations** and **examples** to make it clear.

## ✅ OVERVIEW

This is an implementation of **Dijkstra's Algorithm** using:
- **3D vector** as an adjacency list: `adj[u] = {{v1, w1}, {v2, w2}, ...}`
- **Array-based distance tracking**
- **No priority queue** (uses manual minimum search in each step)

---

### 🔽 HEADER AND NAMESPACE

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>
```

- `iostream`: For input/output
- `vector`: To use dynamic arrays (adjacency list, distances)
- `climits`: For `INT_MAX`, which represents infinity

```cpp
using namespace std;
```
Avoids writing `std::` repeatedly.

---

### 📌 DIJKSTRA FUNCTION

```cpp
vector<int> dijkstra(int V, int source, vector<vector<vector<int>>> &adj)
```

- `V`: Number of vertices
- `source`: Starting node
- `adj`: Adjacency list (3D vector)

**🔍 Example for `adj`:**
```cpp
adj[0] = {{1, 1}, {2, 4}} means:
Node 0 has edges:
  → Node 1 (weight 1)
  → Node 2 (weight 4)
```

---

```cpp
vector<int> dist(V, INT_MAX);
```
- `dist[i]`: Stores the shortest distance from source to node `i`
- Initially all are `INT_MAX` (infinity)

```cpp
vector<bool> Explored(V, false);
```
- Keeps track of whether a node has been finalized/visited.

```cpp
dist[source] = 0;
```
- Distance to the source is 0 (distance from itself)

```cpp
int count = V;
```
- Total iterations = number of nodes

---

### 🔁 MAIN LOOP

```cpp
while (count--)
```
We’ll go through at most `V` iterations to explore all nodes.

---

#### ⛏️ Find Node with Minimum Distance

```cpp
int node = -1, value = INT_MAX;

for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
    if (!Explored[i] && dist[i] < value) {
        node = i;
        value = dist[i];
    }
}
```

- Find the **unvisited** node with the **smallest known distance**.
- Store its index in `node`.

🔍 **Why this?**  
Dijkstra always picks the next "closest" unexplored node.

---

#### 🚫 If no reachable node left

```cpp
if (node == -1)
    break;
```
No more connected nodes — break early.

---

```cpp
Explored[node] = true;
```
Mark the selected node as visited.

---

#### 🔁 Relax Neighbors

```cpp
for (int j = 0; j < adj[node].size(); j++)
```
Loop through all neighbors of the current node.

```cpp
int neighbour = adj[node][j][0];
int weight = adj[node][j][1];
```
- Extract the neighbor index and edge weight

```cpp
if (!Explored[neighbour] && dist[node] + weight < dist[neighbour])
    dist[neighbour] = dist[node] + weight;
```
- Relaxation condition:
  - If we found a **shorter path** to neighbor through current node → update!

---

### ✅ RETURN DISTANCE ARRAY

```cpp
return dist;
```

Gives the shortest distance from source to every node.

---

### 🧪 `main()` FUNCTION

```cpp
int V = 4;
int source = 0;
```
- 4 nodes (0, 1, 2, 3)
- Starting from node 0

---

#### 🌐 Adjacency List Setup

```cpp
vector<vector<vector<int>>> adj(V);
```
3D vector structure.

```cpp
adj[0].push_back({1, 1});
adj[0].push_back({2, 4});
```
Node 0 → Node 1 (w=1), Node 2 (w=4)

```cpp
adj[1].push_back({0, 1});
adj[1].push_back({2, 2});
adj[1].push_back({3, 5});
```
Node 1 → Node 0, 2, 3

...and so on.

🖼️ **Visualization of Graph**:
```
     1       2
0 ------> 1 ----> 3
|         |     ^
|         |     |
|         v     |
+------> 2 ------
     4      1
```

---

### 🔚 Final Output

```cpp
vector<int> result = dijkstra(V, source, adj);
```

Call Dijkstra and get the shortest distances.

```cpp
cout << "Final distance array from source " << source << ":\n[ ";
for (int d : result)
    cout << d << " ";
cout << "]\n";
```

Prints something like:
```
[ 0 1 3 4 ]
```
