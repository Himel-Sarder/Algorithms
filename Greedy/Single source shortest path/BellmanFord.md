This program is implementing the **Bellman-Ford algorithm** to find the shortest paths from a start node, and also checks for **negative weight cycles**.

---

### ðŸ”¸ **Header Files**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
```
- Imports standard input/output functions like `cout`, `cin`.
- Required for printing results.

```cpp
#include <vector>
```
- Allows us to use dynamic arrays (`vector`) from the C++ STL.

```cpp
#include <climits>
```
- Provides constants like `INT_MAX`, which is used to represent **infinity** in our algorithm.

---

### ðŸ”¸ **Struct Definition**

```cpp
struct Edge
{
    int from, to, weight;
};
```
- Defines a custom data structure called `Edge` that stores:
  - `from`: the starting node
  - `to`: the destination node
  - `weight`: the cost of moving from `from` to `to`

### ðŸ“Œ Visualization:

Each edge is like a directed connection:
```
(from) ---> (to) [weight]
```

Example:
```cpp
{0, 1, 4} 
// Means: from node 0 to node 1, the weight is 4
```

---

### ðŸ”¸ **Main Function**

```cpp
int main()
```
- Entry point of the program.

---

### ðŸ”¸ **Graph Setup**

```cpp
int n = 4;
```
- Number of nodes in the graph = 4 (`0`, `1`, `2`, `3`)

```cpp
vector<Edge> edges = {
    {0, 1, 4},
    {0, 2, 1},
    {2, 1, -2},
    {2, 3, 5},
    {1, 3, 1}
};
```
- List of edges in the graph.

### ðŸ“Œ Visualization:

```
    (0)
   /   \
  4     1
 /       \
(1) <---- (2)
  \        |
   1       5
    \      |
     -->  (3)
```

---

### ðŸ”¸ **Initialization**

```cpp
int start = 0;
vector<int> dist(n, INT_MAX);
dist[start] = 0;
```

- `start = 0`: We are calculating shortest paths **from node 0**.
- `dist[n]`: Holds shortest distance to each node, initialized to `INT_MAX` (âˆž).
- `dist[0] = 0`: Distance from start to itself is 0.

ðŸ“Œ At this point:
```cpp
dist = [0, âˆž, âˆž, âˆž]
```

---

### ðŸ”¸ **Bellman-Ford Main Loop**

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i)
```
- Bellman-Ford runs **(n - 1)** times to relax all edges.
- Why? Because in the **worst case**, the shortest path can go through `n-1` edges.

#### Inside the loop:

```cpp
for (auto &e : edges)
```
- Go through every edge in the graph.

```cpp
if (dist[e.from] != INT_MAX && dist[e.to] > dist[e.from] + e.weight)
```
- If:
  - Distance to `e.from` is known
  - And going through `e.from` gives a shorter path to `e.to`

```cpp
dist[e.to] = dist[e.from] + e.weight;
```
- Update the distance to the destination node.

---

### ðŸ“Œ After Each Iteration (example):

#### Iteration 1:
```cpp
dist[0] = 0
Edge (0â†’1, weight 4) â†’ dist[1] = 0 + 4 = 4
Edge (0â†’2, weight 1) â†’ dist[2] = 0 + 1 = 1
Edge (2â†’1, weight -2) â†’ dist[1] = 1 - 2 = -1
Edge (1â†’3, weight 1) â†’ dist[3] = -1 + 1 = 0
```

After 1st pass:
```cpp
dist = [0, -1, 1, 0]
```

Iterations 2 and 3 will not change anything (already optimal paths found).

---

### ðŸ”¸ **Negative Cycle Detection**

```cpp
bool hasNegativeCycle = false;
for (auto &e : edges)
{
    if (dist[e.from] != INT_MAX && dist[e.to] > dist[e.from] + e.weight)
    {
        hasNegativeCycle = true;
        break;
    }
}
```

- If we can still relax any edge **after** `n - 1` iterations, it means there's a **negative cycle** (loop with total weight < 0).
- In this graph, there's **no negative cycle**.

---

### ðŸ”¸ **Output Section**

```cpp
if (hasNegativeCycle)
    cout << "Graph contains negative weight cycle!\n";
```
- Warns if there's a negative cycle (infinite loop possible).

```cpp
else
{
    cout << "Shortest distances from node " << start << ":\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    {
        if (dist[i] == INT_MAX)
            cout << i << ": INF\n";
        else
            cout << i << ": " << dist[i] << "\n";
    }
}
```
- Prints the shortest distance to each node from the start.

---

### âœ… Final Output:
```
Shortest distances from node 0:
0: 0
1: -1
2: 1
3: 0
```
